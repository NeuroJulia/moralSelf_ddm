This folder includes the data and the script for pilot study. This folder has thre sub-folders and the jasp file for sequential analysis during data collection.

1_preproc ---- raw data and the R script for preprocessing the raw data and plot (Fig 3 in the manuscript).

2_trad_analysis ---- preprocessed data for ANOVAs, JASP files, and plots for Robustness check of BF.

3_hddm ---- preprocessed data for HDDM and python scripts in jupyter notebook and .py files. These two jupyter files include the code that produce the results as reported in the manuscript: HDDM_MS_Rep_match_stim.ipynb; HDDM_MS_Rep_categ_stim.ipynb. These three files include the code for accuracy-code HDDM modelling: HDDM_MS_rep_id_linux_final.py; HDDM_MS_rep_val_linux_final.py; HDDM_MS_rep_match_linux_final.py
